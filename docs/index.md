# Workshop in Applied and Theoretical Economics (WATE) 2022

With the goal of providing a forum where Floridian researchers in economics can meet and exchange ideas, University of South Florida’s Department of Economics is happy to sponsor the 4th Annual WATE‐Florida. We hope you take this opportunity to submit a paper or participate in the conference to help strengthen the research community within the state of Florida.
